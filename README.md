## Description

The program uses a linked list structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains an integer value and a reference to the next node. The main operations supported by the program are:

- Insertion:
  - Insert an element at the beginning of the list.
  - Insert an element at the end of the list.
  - Insert an element after a specific element in the list.

- Deletion:
  - Delete the first element of the list.
  - Delete the last element of the list.
  - Delete a specific element from the list.

- Search:
  - Search for an element with a specified value in the list.

- Sorting:
  - Sort the elements of the list in ascending order based on their values.

- Display:
  - Display all the elements of the list.

## Installation

To compile and run the program, you need a C compiler such as GCC. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/steepcloud/singly-linear-linked-list.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd singly-linear-linked-list/Singly Linear Linked List/Singly Linear Linked List
   ```
3. Compile the source code:
   ```shell
   gcc main.c -o linked_list
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```shell
   ./linked_list
   ```
   
## Usage
After running the program, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to perform various operations on the linked list. Use the number keys to select an option and press Enter.

Insertion: Choose option 1 to access the insertion submenu. Then, follow the prompts to insert elements at the beginning, end, or after a specific element in the list.

Deletion: Choose option 2 to access the deletion submenu. Then, follow the prompts to delete the first element, last element, or a specific element from the list.

Search: Choose option 3 to search for an element with a specified value in the list. Enter the value to search for, and the program will indicate whether the element was found or not.

Show: Choose option 4 to display all the elements of the list.

Sort: Choose option 5 to sort the elements of the list in ascending order based on their values.

Exit: Choose option 0 to exit the program.
